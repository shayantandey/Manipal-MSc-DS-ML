```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
#### Check the datasets available in R

```{r}
data() # lists all the availale datasets
?mtcars # Details of the mtcars dataset
```


```{r}
# Load the Motor Trend Car Road Tests (mtcars) dataset
carData = read.csv('mtcars.csv')
#carData = mtcars

# Print the first five rows (or samples) in the data frame
head(carData, 5)

# Print the structure of the data frame 
str(carData)

# Print the names of the columns (features or variables)
colnames(carData)

# Print the number of samples (rows) and features (columns) in the data frame
nrow(carData)
ncol(carData)
```

```{r}
# Basic data management using the tidyverse package

# mutate() function is used to add new columns (features or variables) or modify current ones
# Add a new column called cyltype
carData %>% mutate(cyltype = 'High')
carData %>% mutate(cyltype = ifelse(cyl >6, 'High', 'Low'))

# Add a new column called wtton
carData %>% mutate(wtton = 0.45*wt)

# Create a new data frame with the cyltype and wtton added
carData.new = carData %>% mutate(cyltype = ifelse(cyl >6, 'High', 'Low'), wtton = 0.45*wt)
str(carData.new)
head(carData.new, 5)

# summarize() function collapses all rows (samples) and returns a summary
# Return the mean weight (in tons) of the cars
carData.new %>% summarise(mean(wtton))

# Return the mean weight (in tons) and mean displacement of the cars
carData.new %>% summarise(mean(wtton), mean(disp))

# group_by() function is used to group samples according to features
# Group cars according to cyltype and calculate mean weight and mean displacement
carData.new %>% group_by(cyltype) %>%
  summarise(mean(wtton), mean(disp))

# filter() function is used to retain samples satisfying a specific condition
# Filter cars that weight more than 2 tons
carData.new %>% filter (wtton > 2)

# Filter cars that weight more than 2 tons and have more than 4 cylinders
carData.new %>% filter (wtton > 2 & cyl > 4)

# select() function is used to retain specific features
# Select only the feature wtton
carData.new %>% select(wtton)

# Select everything except the feature wtton
carData.new %>% select(-wtton)

# Select only the features cyltype and wtton
carData.new %>% select(cyltype, wtton)

# Select everything except the features cyltype and wtton
carData.new %>% select(-cyltype, -wtton)

```

```{r}
# Initiate the ggplot() function binding to the data frame
ggplot(data = carData)
#ggplot(data = carData.new)

# Create a plot object
carplot = ggplot(data = carData)

# Use the aes() function to specify the aesthetic mapping, that is, which variables should be plotted
carplot = ggplot(data = carData, aes(x = wt, y = disp))

# Use the geom_ type functions to add geometric elements
carplot = ggplot(data = carData, aes(x = wt, y = disp)) +
  geom_point()

# Add labels and title
carplot = carplot + labs(x = 'Weight (lbs)', y = 'Displacement (cu. in.)', title = 'Weight vs. Displacement')
carplot
